# Binary Search

Binary Search is a very simple, intuitive, yet efficient searching algorithm. The only caveat is that it works only sorted arrays, so some preprocessing on our data in order to sort it might be necessary.

## Time Complexity

- Worst Case: O(log n)
- Average Case O(log n)
- Best Case - O(1)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
