# Linear(Sequential) Search
Linear(Sequential) search is a very simple algorithm. Finds the target number by checking the numbers one by one from start to finish. 

---

## Time Complexity
- Worst Case: O(n) - The last number in the array is the target number.
- Average Case O(n)
- Best Case O(1) - The first number in the array is the target number.
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
