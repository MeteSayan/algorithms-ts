# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. In this comparison-based algorithm, each element in the list is compared with the next element. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

## Time Complexity

- Worst Case: O(n²) - Quadratic Time Complexity (The worst case occurs when an array is reverse sorted.)
- Average Case O(n²) - Quadratic Time Complexity
- Best Case O(n) - Linear Time Complexity (The best case occurs when an array is already sorted.)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
